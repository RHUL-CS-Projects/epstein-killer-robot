# The Case of the Killer Robot

## by Richard G. Epstein

The _Case of the Killer Robot_ consists of seven newspaper articles, one
journal article and one magazine interview. This scenario is intended to raise
issues in computer ethics and in software engineering.

The text has kindly been made available by its author for many years. This repo
is a Jekyll site with styling to help students investigate it on a web browser.

### About the headshots (or: who are these people?)

The characters in the documents are fictional; so the photographs are too.
Specifically, the headshots were taken from
[thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com).
They were imagined by a Generative Adversarial Network
(specifically, [StyleGAN2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan) (Dec 2019) —
Karras et al. and Nvidia).
