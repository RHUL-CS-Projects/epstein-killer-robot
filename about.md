### About the headshots (or: who are these people?)

The characters in the documents are fictional; so the photographs are too.
Specifically, the headshots were taken from
[thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com).
They were imagined by a Generative Adversarial Network
(specifically, [StyleGAN2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan) (Dec 2019) —
Karras et al. and Nvidia).
