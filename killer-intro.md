The _Case of the Killer Robot_ consists of seven newspaper articles, one
journal article and one magazine interview. This scenario is intended to raise
issues in computer ethics and in software engineering.

The persons and institutions involved in this scenario are entirely fictitious
(except for the references to Carnegie-Mellon and Purdue Universities and to
the venerable computer scientists: Ben Shneiderman and Jim Foley). Silicon
Valley was chosen as the location for the accident because Silicon Valley is an
icon of high technology. All of the persons and institutions named in Silicon
Valley are purely fictitious.
