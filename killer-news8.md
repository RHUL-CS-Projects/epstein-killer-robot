Cindy Yardley, a software tester at Silicon Techtronics, admitted today that
she was the person who created the fraudulent "killer robot" software tests.
The fraudulent tests were revealed earlier this week by Silicon Valley
University professor Wesley Silber in what has come to be known as the "Silber
Report."

At issue are quality assurance procedures that were performed on the program
code written by Randy Samuels, the programmer charged with manslaughter in the
killer robot incident. The Silber Report asserted that the test results
reflected in internal Silicon Techtronics documents were inconsistent with the
test results obtained when the actual killer-robot code was tested.

In a startling development at noontime yesterday, Max Worthington, Chief
Security Officer for Silicon Techtronics, announced his resignation at a packed
news conference that was broadcast live by CNN and other news organizations.

Worthington stunned the assembled reporters when he began his news conference
with the announcement, "I am Martha."

Worthington described his responsibilities at Silicon Techtronics in this way:
"Basically, my job was to protect Silicon Techtronics from all enemies —
domestic and foreign. By foreign I mean adversaries from outside the
corporation. My role was mostly managerial. Those working under me had many
responsibilities, including protecting the physical plant, watching out for
industrial spying and even sabotage. I was also responsible for keeping an eye
out for employees who might be abusing drugs or who might be disloyal in some
way to Silicon Techtronics."

Worthington then pointed to a stack of bound volumes which were on a table to
his left. "These volumes represent just some of the electronic surveillance of
employees that I conducted over the years for my superior, Mr. Waterson. These
are printouts of electronic mail messages that Silicon Techtronics employees
sent to one another and to persons at other sites. I can say with great
certainly that no employee was ever told that this kind of electronic
surveillance was being conducted. However, I think the evidence shows that some
employees suspected that this might be going on."

Several reporters shouted questions asking who at Silicon Techtronics knew
about the electronic surveillance.

Worthington replied, "No one knew about this except Mr. Waterson, myself, and
one of my assistants, who was responsible for conducting the actual monitoring.
My assistant produced a special report, summarizing e-mail [electronic mail]
activity once a week, and that report was for Waterson's eyes and my eyes,
only. Upon request, my assistant could produce a more detailed accounting of
electronic communications."

Worthington explained that he was making the electronic mail transcripts
available to the press because he wanted the whole truth to come out concerning
Silicon Techtronics and the killer robot incident.

The electronic mail messages between employees at Silicon Techtronics indeed
revealed new facets of the case. A message from Cindy Yardley to Robotics
Division Chief Ray Johnson indicates that she faked the test results at his
request. Here is the text of that message:


<div class="email" markdown="1">
To:       ray.johnson
<br>From:  cindy.yardlay
<br>
<br>Re:      samuels software

I have finished creating the software test results for that
troublesome robot software, as per your idea of using a
simulation rather than the actual software.   Attached you
will find the modified test document, showing the
successful simulation.

Should we tell Randy about this?

Johnson's response to Yardley's message suggests that he
suspected that electronic mail might not be secure:

<div class="email" markdown="1">
In-reply-to:   cindy.yardley
<br>From:           ray.johnson
<br>
<br>Re:     samuel's software

I knew I could count on you!   I am sure that your devotion
to Silicon Techtronics will be repaid in full.

Please use a more secure form of communication in the
future when discussing this matter.  I assure you that the
way we handled this was completely above board, but I
have my enemies here at good ol' SiliTech.

These communications were exchanged just a few days before the Robbie
CX30 robot was shipped out to Cybernetics, Inc.  This fact is
important because the fake software tests were not part of a cover-up
of the killer robot incident.  These facts seem to indicate that the
purpose of the fake software tests was to make sure that the Robbie
CX30 robot was delivered to Cybernetics by a deadline that was
negotiated between Silicon Techtronics and Cybernetics.

The electronic mail transcripts reveal repeated messages from Ray
Johnson to various people to the effect that the Robotics Division
would definitely be closed down if the Robbie CX30 project was not
completed on time.  In one message, he lectures project leader, Sam
Reynolds, on his "Ivory Snow Theory":

<div class="email" markdown="1">
To:       sam.reynolds
<br>From:  ray.johnson
<br>
<br>Re:      don't be a perfectionist!

Sam:

You and I have had our differences, but I must tell you
that I like you personally.  Please understand that
everything I am doing is for the purpose of SAVING
YOUR JOB AND THE JOB OF EVERYONE IN THIS
DIVISION.   I view you and all of the people who work with
me in the Robotics Division as my family.

Waterson has made it clear:  he wants the robot project
completed on time.  That's the bottom line.   Thus, we
have no recourse but "Ivory Snow."   You know what I
mean by that.  It doesn't have to be perfect.   The user
interface is our fall back if this version of the robot
software has some flaws.  The robot operator will be safe
because the operator will be able to abort any robot
motion at any time.

I agree with you that the non-functional requirements are
too vague in places.  Ideally, if this weren't crunch time, it
would be good to quantify the amount of time it would take
the operator to stop the robot in case of an accident.
However, we cannot renegotiate those now.  Nor, do we
have time to design new tests for new, more precise non-
functional requirements.

I cannot emphasize enough that this is crunch time.   It's
no sweat off Waterson's back if he lops off the entire
Robotics Division.  His Wall Street friends will just say,
"Congratulations!"   You see, to Waterson, we are not a
family, we are just corporate fat.

In this message, Ray Johnson seems to be less concered with
the security of communicating by electronic mail.

The Silicon-Observer interviewed Cindy Yardley at her home
yesterday evening.   Neither Ray Johnson nor Sam Reynolds
could be reached for comment.

      and Cindy Yardley, software tester: "He
      told me that the robot was safe."

Ms. Yardley was obviously upset that her private electronic mail
messages had been released to the press.  "I am relieved in some ways.
I felt tremendous guilt when that guy was killed by a robot that I
helped to produce.  Tremendous guilt."

The Silicon-Observer asked Ms. Yardley whether she felt that she had
made an ethical choice in agreeing to fake the software test results.
She responded with great emotion: "Nothing, nothing in my experience
or background prepared me for something like this.  I studied computer
science at a major university and they taught me about software
testing, but they never told me that someone with power over me might
ask me to produce a fake software test!"

"When Johnson asked me to do this, he called me to his office, as if
to show me the trappings of power, you see, someday I would like to be
in a managerial position.  I sat down in his office and he came right
out and said, 'I want you to fake the test results on that Samuels
software.  I don't want Reynolds to know anything about this.'"

Yardley fought back tears.  "He assured me that no one would probably
ever see the test results because the robot was perfectly safe.  It
was just an internal matter, a matter of cleanliness, in case anyone
at Cybernetics or higher up in the corporation got curious about our
test results.  I asked him whether he was sure about the robot being
safe and all that and he said, 'It's safe!  The user interface is our
line of defense.  In about six months we can issue a second version of
the robotics software and by then this Samuels problem will be
solved.'"

Yardley leaned forward in her chair as if her next remark needed
special emphasis.  "He then told me that if I did not fake the
software tests, then everyone in the Robotics Division would lose
their job.  On that basis I decided to fake the test results — I was
trying to protect my job and the job of my co-workers."

Ms. Yardley is currently pursuing an MBA degree at night at
Silicon Valley University.

The Sentinel-Observer then asked Ms. Yardley whether she still
felt that she had made an ethical decision, in view of the death
of Bart Matthews.  "I think I was misled by Ray Johnson.  He
told me that the robot was safe."

Another revelation, contained in the released electronic mail
transcripts, was the fact that Randy Samuels stole some of the
software that he used in the killer robot project.  This fact was
revealed in a message Samuels sent to Yardley when she first tested
his software and it gave erroneous results:

<div class="email" markdown="1">

<br>
<br>Re:      damned if I know

I cannot for the life of me figure out what is wrong with this
function, swing_arm().   I've checked the robot dynamics
formula over and over again, and it seems to be
implemented correctly.   As you know, swing_arm() calls
14 different functions.   I lifted five of those from the
PACKSTAT 1-2-3 statistical package verbatim.  Please
don't tell a soul! Those couldn't be the problem, could
they?

-- Randy
</div>

Experts tell the Silicon-Observer that lifting software from a commercial
software package like PACKSTAT 1-2-3 is a violation of the law. Software such
as the immensely popular PACKSTAT 1-2-3 is protected by the same kind of
copyright that protects printed materials.

Mike Waterson, CEO of Silicon Techtronics issued an angry statement concerning
Max Worthington's release of "confidential" electronic mail transcripts.
Waterson's statement said, in part, "I have asked our attorneys to look into
this matter. We consider those transcripts the exclusive property of Silicon
Techtronics. Our intent is to pursue either civil or criminal charges against
Mr. Worthington."

In reaction to yesterday's developments in the killer robot case, the ACM or
Association for Computing Machinery announced its intention to investigate
whether any ACM members at Silicon Techtronics have violated the ACM Code of
Ethics. The ACM is an international association of computer scientists with
85,000 members.

Dr. Turina Babbage, ACM President, issued a statement from the ACM's Computer
Science Conference, which is held every winter and which is being held this
winter in Duluth, Minnesota.

An excerpt from Dr.  Babbage's statement follows:

> All members of the ACM are bound by the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional
> Conduct<sup>[note-1](#footnote-1)</sup>. This code states, in part, that ACM
> members have the general moral imperative to contribute to society and human
> well-being, to avoid harm to others, to be honest and trustworthy, to give
> proper credit for intellectual property, to access computing and
> communication resources only when authorized to do so, to respect the privacy
> of others and to honor confidentiality.
> 
> Beyond that, there are professional responsibilities, such as the obligation
> to honor contracts, agreements, and assigned responsibilities, and to give
> comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computing systems and their
> impacts, with special emphasis on possible risks.
> 
> Several of the people involved in the killer robot case are ACM members and
> there is cause to believe that they have acted in violation of our
> association's code of ethics. Therefore, I am asking the ACM Board to appoint
> a Task Force to investigate ACM members who might be in gross violation of
> the code.
> 
> We do not take this step lightly. This sanction has been applied only rarely,
> but the killer robot incident has not only cost a human life, but it has done
> much to damage the reputation of the computing profession.
